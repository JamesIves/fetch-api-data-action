# Fetch API Data Action üì¶ üöö

## Work in Progress (Pre-Release)

This GitHub action will handle authenticated API requests for you, allowing you to save the data from the request into your workspace as an environment variable or a `.json` file. Using this action will allow you to save data from these queries on a schedule so they can be used in a static page.

## Getting Started ‚úàÔ∏è
You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that GitHub actions supports. You'll need to provide the action with the endpoint you'd like to request along with [any configuration options](TODO:).

```yml
name: Refresh Feed
on: [push]
jobs:
  refresh-feed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch API Data
        uses: JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action@releases/v1
        with:
          ENDPOINT: https://example.com
          CONFIGURATION: '{ "method": "GET", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"} }'
          SAVE: true
          
```

Once the action has run the requested data will be exported as `FETCH_API_DATA` and will be available as a `.json` file in your workspace as `fetch-api-data/data.json`.

You can combine this action with the github-pages-deploy-action to trigger scheduled updates to a feed on your website.

```yml
name: Refresh Feed
on: [push]
jobs:
  refresh-feed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch API Data
        uses: JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action@releases/v1
        with:
          ENDPOINT: https://example.com
          CONFIGURATION: '{ "method": "GET", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"} }'
          SAVE: true
```
