# Fetch API Data Action üì¶ üöö
[![Build Status](https://github.com/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action/workflows/unit-tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action/actions) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action.svg?logo=github)](https://github.com/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action/releases) [![Codecov Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action/branch/dev)

This [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) will handle authenticated API requests for you, allowing you to save the data from the request into your workspace as an environment variable and a `.json` file. Using this action will allow you to save data from these queries on a schedule so they can be used in a static page without exposing your API credentials.

This action was originally created for the [2020 GitHub Actions Hackathon](https://github.community/t5/Events/Featured-Event-GitHub-Actions-Hackathon/td-p/48206).

## Getting Started ‚úàÔ∏è
You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). You'll need to provide the action with the endpoint you'd like to request along with [any configuration options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) as [stringified JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp).

```yml
name: Refresh Feed
on: [push]
jobs:
  refresh-feed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch API Data
        uses: JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action@releases/v1
        with:
          ENDPOINT: https://example.com
          CONFIGURATION: '{ "method": "GET", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"} }'
```

Once the action has run the requested data will be exported into the `FETCH_API_DATA` environment variable and will also be available as a `.json` file in your workspace located by default in the `fetch-api-data/data.json` directory.

You can combine the use of this with the [GitHub Pages Deploy Action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) to trigger scheduled updates to a feed on your website.

<summary>You can view a full example of this here.</summary>

In one workflow you can fetch data from an API on a schedule and push it to your `master` branch.

```yml
name: Refresh Feed
on: 
  schedule:
    - cron: 10 15 * * 0-6
jobs:
  refresh-feed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
  
      - name: Fetch API Data
        uses: JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action@releases/v1
        with:
          ENDPOINT: https://example.com
          CONFIGURATION: '{ "method": "GET", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"} }'

      - name: Build and Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
        with:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: master
          FOLDER: fetch-api-data-action
          TARGET_FOLDER: data
```

 In another workflow you can then build and deploy your page whenever a push is made to that branch.

 ```yml
 name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Install
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run-script build

      - name: Build and Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
        with:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: gh-pages
          FOLDER: build
```

In your project you can import the JSON file and make it part of your build script. This way your site will re-build and deploy whenever refreshed data has been fetched from the server.

## Configuration üìÅ

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

#### Required Setup

The following configuration options must be set.

| Key            | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Type             | Required |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| `ENDPOINT`          | The URL of the endpoint you'd like to retrieve data from. For example: `https://example.com/data`.                                                                                                                                                           | `with`           | **Yes**  |
| `CONFIGURATION` | Any applicable configuration settings that should be set such as authentication tokens. You can reference secrets using the `${{ secrets.secret_name }}` syntax, or you can reference data returned from the `TOKEN_ENDPOINT` request using the triple bracket syntax: `{{{ data.access_token }}}`. For more information refer to the [Token Request part of the readme](https://github.com/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action#token-request-%EF%B8%8F) and the [Fetch API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).                                                                                                | `secrets / with` | **Yes**  |

#### Optional Choices

| Key            | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Type             | Required |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| `TOKEN_ENDPOINT`          | If the `ENDPOINT` API requires you to make a request to get an access token prior to fetching data you can perform this task by specifying a token endpoint. Any data returned from the token end can be referenced in the `CONFIGURATION` variable using the triple bracket syntax: `{{{ access_token }}}`. For more information refer to the [Token Request part of the readme](https://github.com/JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action#token-request-%EF%B8%8F);                                                                                                                                                         | `with`           | **No**  |
| `TOKEN_CONFIGURATION` | Any applicable configuration settings that should be set such as authentication tokens. You can reference secrets using the `${{ secrets.secret_name }}` syntax. For more information refer to the [Fetch API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).                                                                                               | `secrets / with` | **No**  |
| `SAVE_LOCATION` | By default the save location of the JSON file is `fetch-api-data-action/data.json`, if you'd like to override the directory you can do so by specifying a new one with this variable.                                                                                                | `with` | **No**  |
| `SAVE_NAME` | You can override the name of the exported `.json` file by specifying a new one here. You should _not_ include the file extension in your name.                                                                                                | `with` | **No**  |

### Token Request üéüÔ∏è

If you need to make a request to another endpoint in order to request an access token or something similar you can do so using the `TOKEN_ENDPOINT` and `TOKEN_CONFIGURATION` parameters. You can then use the returned token in your `CONFIGURATION` variable using the triple  syntax like so `{{{ tokens.access_token }}}`. You can find an example of this below.

```yml

name: Refresh Feed
on: [push]
jobs:
  refresh-feed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch API Data
        uses: JamesIves/fetch-api-data-action@releases/v1
        with:
          TOKEN_ENDPOINT: https://example.com/auth/token
          TOKEN_CONFIGURATION: '{ "method": "GET", "body": {"client_id": "${{ secrets.client_id }}", "client_secret": "${{ secrets.client_secret }}"} }'
          ENDPOINT: https://example.com/data
          # The token here is returned from the TOKEN_ENDPOINT call. The returned data looks like so: {data: {access_token: '123'}}
          CONFIGURATION: '{ "method": "GET", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer {{{ data.access_token }}}"} }'
```
